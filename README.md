# Python Matrix Build Project (Pandas vs. Polars)

![Python Versions - 3.7/3.8/3.9](https://github.com/aghakishiyeva/ids706-mini-project-4/actions/workflows/python-matrix.yml/badge.svg)

This project demonstrates a matrix build using GitHub Actions to run a script with different Python versions. The script showcases processing data using both Pandas and Polars libraries and outputs the time taken by each library.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Development 

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the data_processing.py script to see the processing time for both libraries:

```bash
python data_processing.py
```

### 🧪 Running Tests

Currently, this project does not have tests, but if any are added in the future, they can be run using pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

This would run all the unit tests to ensure that any changes made haven't introduced new issues.
